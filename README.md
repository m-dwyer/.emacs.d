# emacs
My emacs config

## What

A repository to document my own personal emacs config, largely inspired by [System Crafters / David Wilson](https://github.com/daviwil), and others!

## Why

After jumping around 'productivity systems' (a very loose term) such as Notion, Obsidian, etc - I discovered org-mode and thought it would be great to heavily integrate emacs into my daily workflow - for note taking, basic TODO items, projects, etc.

This repository serves to document my local ~/.emacs.d emacs config, as I discover what does/doesn't work for me in Emacs based on my use case(s).

## How

1. Install emacs
2. Clone this repository into ~/.emacs.d
3. Enjoy
